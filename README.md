# Kaggle Competition - Bike Sharing demand

https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand/

Solution is split into 4 parts:
* Data exploration: Data Exploration ipython notebook
* Features & ML techniques exploration: Exploring new features and different ML techniques ipython notebook
* Tuning parameters using Random Forest & Gradient Boosting Regressor: parameter_tuning.py
* Generating sample submission: generate_submission.py

Best model is getting about ~0.445 RMSLE on kaggle website

Future work:
* try more models & parameters (No free lunch theorem)
* try to find best set of features not just add more and more
* create new features, feature engineering
